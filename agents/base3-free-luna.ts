/**
 * Deliberately NO `reasoningOptions`, unlike the base2-free-luna it replaces.
 *
 * An agent-declared reasoning reaches the wire as `body.reasoning`, which makes
 * the agent the authority on effort and leaves applyObitobuffReasoningDefaults
 * unable to tell a model default apart from a user's pick — so the effort
 * control silently does nothing on exactly the models people most want to tune.
 * The catalog is the single source (ObitobuffModelOption.reasoningEffort /
 * .efforts) and the server fills Luna's effort in either way, so dropping it
 * changes no request except the ones where the user chose.
 *
 * Same rule the Web base3 roots follow (createWebBase3Root has no such
 * parameter at all, so nothing can re-break it there).
